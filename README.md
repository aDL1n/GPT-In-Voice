# <p style="text-align:center">GPT-In-Voice</p>
This is a Discord bot that turns a voice channel into a live conversation with LLM. It connects to the voice, recognizes the participants' speech, understands who is speaking, and responds with voice using models like ChatGPT.

> ⚠️ The project is under development.

## Features

- Connect to a voice channel on command (forced or request)
- Listen to voice chat and translate audio into text
- Send a recognized replica to LLM (e.g. ChatGPT)
